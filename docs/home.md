The app's "dashboard", where all the Pokemon are presented in an infinitely-scrolling list. Each list item contains that Pokemon's picture and ID number. As the user scrolls, more Pokemon are loaded. Clicking on a list item directs the user to the detail page. _(TODO: add link to detail page)_

## Specs
* Retrieve 50 Pokemon on initial load
* Display Pokemon as list items
	* List item contains Pokemon's picture and ID 
* Retrieve next 50 Pokemon when user scrolls 75% down the page
